# Overview

Welcome to the TackleBox, my repository that houses a diverse collection of projects and scripts.

**Check out all the goodies in this repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/Cinderblook/tacklebox).**

## A Quick Peek

Greetings, fellow tech enthusiasts! I thought it would be a great idea to showcase the mishmash of projects and scripts I've accumulated in this repository of mine, aptly named the TackleBox. Within this repository, you'll find a wide range of content, from network automation scripts using PowerShell and Ansible to infrastructure-as-code solutions with Packer and Terraform. I also explore various mini-projects involving Docker containers and dabble in the world of Kubernetes.

As someone who constantly seeks ways to streamline my workflow and simplify my life, I realized that the best approach would be to create a well-organized repository containing thorough documentation and useful scripts that I create along the way.

So please, take a look around, and you might discover something valuable: [TackleBox - GitHub](https://github.com/Cinderblook/tacklebox)
