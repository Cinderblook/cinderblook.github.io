# Overview
A look into the tacklebox

**Check out all of goods for this repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/Cinderblook/tacklebox).**

## A Quick Peak

Hey there, fellow tech users! I figured this may be a good spot to put out there my sort of jumbled up mix of a variety of things I store in this repository of mine. The Tacklebox. You can find anything from network automation scripts with powershell and ansible, to infrastructure as a code solutions with Packer and Terraform. I also dive into various mini projects consisting of Docker containers and some kubernetes dabbling.

As someone who is constantly looking for ways to streamline my workflow and make my life easier, I figured the best way to handle this, would be to create a thoughtful repo containing a bunch of documentation and scripts I make here and there.

So please, take a look, and maybe you'll find some of it useful: [Tacklebox - GitHub](https://github.com/Cinderblook/tacklebox)
